# Teaching Techniques

*24 January 2021*

[Here](https://www.rahulmehta.com/edu02.htm#techniques), Rahul Mehta has written that 

>In the Saatya Procedures, the student or his parents pick the teacher they like and the reward system ensures full motivation of teacher and student. So that a student can learn at his own pace, the reward system allows student (and his teachers) of any age to get rewards.

>Now it is completely left with teacher to pick the teaching technique and if the parents are unhappy, they can switch the teacher. The teaching techniques are NOT part of EDU.02 [Aside : the best Maths-teaching system I have come across is Kumon System and I will describe it in some other booklet.]

Now, the last line, i.e. "the best Maths-teaching system I have come across is Kumon System and I will describe it in some other booklet." intrigued me. I went on and studied about the Kumon System of teaching Mathematics. I had previously studied some English at Kumon and my younger brother had studied Mathematics, so I went on to ask him how it worked. He remembered it vaguely, so I went on to read about it on the itnernet. Unfortunately, there is very limited information about Kumon (with practically little to no study material uploaded on the internet). I also contacted Mr. Mehta himself and asked him if he has written that "booklet" he was talking about in that article. He told me to contact a Kumon center and ask them how it works and also told me that I wouldn't be able to find much about it because it is a business. 

I found there [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/kumon), and from there I found [Academic Hub](https://academichub.ru). On Academic Hub, you can find some of their worksheets (especially for higher levels). 

In addition, I also went through [kumon.com](https://kumon.com) and [https://kumon.org) and understood their method of learning.

In this blog post, I'll summarize everything for you so that you can understand their method of learning. 

I'd suggest that you first read this article of theirs I've reproduced here:

**How is Kumon Different from School Math?**

From [kumon.com](https://kumon.com)
 
Dribble, pass, shoot! Young soccer players complete endless drills learning these core skills before ever using them in a game. When it comes time to apply them in an actual competition, the moves come automatically. Similarly, many violinists learn proper hand positioning before they ever pick up a bow. When they begin to play, they’re simply stringing together the basic skills they’ve already mastered.
 
What do soccer and the violin have to do with Kumon? Just as athletes and musicians learn skills before applying them in games or performances, students in Kumon learn math skills before applying them in real-life situations. This is a key difference between Kumon Math and the math that is taught in most school systems in North America. It’s also what makes Kumon the perfect supplement to school math.
 
Mathematics vs. the Application of Mathematics
 
While school curriculums can vary significantly, most school math programs teach the application of math. That means that students learn math as it is used in the real world. For example, students might learn addition through scenarios like, “Emma has one apple in her basket. She adds one more apple to the basket. Emma now has two apples.” This may seem like an intuitive way to learn math—after all, that’s how most of us were introduced to adding. And what’s the point of learning math if you can’t use it in the real world?
 
As the math concepts get more difficult, the real-life application gets more complex, compounding the problem. A naturally talented soccer player may be able to excel on a recreational team without having honed her skills, but as the level of competition gets more difficult, her skill gaps will become more apparent. Similarly, a math student may be able to grasp basic concepts with little practice, but as the math gets more challenging, the gaps will begin to show.
 
Unlike school, Kumon teaches strictly mathematics. In Kumon, it is not technically necessary to understand how to apply 1+1=2 in the real world. Students simply must learn that 1+1=2 is a true statement. Students then learn that 2+1=3, 3+1=4, and so on. Math is taught incrementally, with students progressing step-by-step from counting all the way through calculus. As students do not need to have real world experience to learn what is strictly mathematics, even elementary school students can progress to algebra and beyond. Eventually, as students’ number sense and real world experience come together, they are able to apply what they’ve learned in different contexts.
 
Some might find it counterintuitive to learn mathematics without its applications. After all, why learn what one plus one equals if you can’t make the connection that adding one penny to another equals two cents? However, once a student has learned a math concept, they then have an easier time learning how to apply it. Some math applications are included in the Kumon Program, but it is only introduced once a student has mastered the mathematical concepts. Without a strong base in the necessary math skills, students will reach a point where applying math is too difficult.  Just as a soccer player learns how to dribble the ball before applying that skill in a game, students should learn math skills before applying the concepts in real life situations.

[About Kumon’s Method of Learning](https://www.kumongroup.com/eng/about-kumon/method/)
 
I propose the following method to make school Math just like Kumon Math.
 
**Dividing course into “units”:** Just like Kumon has 21 levels, divide the entire syllabus of CBSE Mathematics Class-I to Class-XII into 12*4 = 48 units. The students may take as much time as they wish to complete a unit, ensuring that they can learn at their own pace.

**Assessment Test:** After one completes a unit, there will be an assessment test, which the student will have to pass to move on to the next unit. This ensures continuous motivation which is not possible when there is one test at the end of the year. As there are four tests for the current annual curriculum, the test maker can test the students on a wider variety of problems in a single assessment which is not possible when there is one annual assessment.

- *Worksheets:* Each unit will have several worksheets, and each worksheet will introduce a concept to the student with text, (an) example(s) and problems based on that. [An example of a worksheet](https://academichub.ru/viewer/h4XDlT2uZMK65d6vX5BfJ0QVWAsztOmlqefBBDyhByAAAAFzZjI5uAAAAABhYy10cmFuc2Zvcm0vZjVlYmRkOTZmZjhjMDBiODBmMGQ0Y2UxY2EyOWQxMzA2MzgyYzVkMTBmNGMxNWFjNGZiYThhNzYxM2EwMDZlYS5qcGct-,2.O%201a.jpg?pt=L3Jlc291cmNlcy9rdW1vbi9tYXRoL08vQW5zd2VyJTIwQm9vayUyMCgyMDIwKSUyMCU1Qk5FVyU1RCUyMCU1QkZTJTVE). [The text written after [Sol.] will be absent in the student’s copy.]

- *Writing new text material:* Write text material which assumes the absence of a lecture and thoroughly explains the concept, unlike a textbook. Reading text independently forces the student to think actively. IMO it is the best way to promote real-learning, unlike passive mediums like lectures/videos where information is fed into the student.

- *Examples:* The examples should be sufficient to demonstrate how a concept is applied to solve various problems which the student will have to solve later.

- *Increasing difficulty of problems in small increments:* Order problems such that they increase in difficulty in very small increments. [This makes it possible for students to form connections in their minds between the new concepts and topics they have already studied](https://www.kumon.com/resources/what-is-the-kumon-method/). 

**Mastery:** The teacher will ask the student to redo problems they answered incorrectly and may give more problems related to the same concept until they answer all correctly. This allows the student to master each concept completely before learning a new one.
Individualised Instruction: There will be no lecture with a teacher and 30-40 students. Teachers will be available for the students individually to help them get away with their difficulties. This helps the teacher to know each student’s progress and give them individual guidance.

**Self-learning:** The student will first have to self learn the concepts by reading the text and the examples and try the problems. The teacher will be available for the students if they are facing difficulty in understanding the material. If the student is not able to solve a problem, the teacher won't directly give the solution. Instead, the teacher will provide hints and guide students to be aware of the [focal points of questions and think about the information that is given in the worksheet, supporting them to solve problems by themselves](https://www.kumon.org/our-method/). This helps the student to develop a habit of self-learning, one of the most important IMO.

**Placement Test:** If a student comes from another curriculum, they will be required to take a placement test using which the teacher will place him/her into the right unit. The teacher may put him/her to a lower unit just so that it is easy for them to grasp in the new learning environment and develop confidence.
 
The above method allows the student to learn at his own pace, continuous motivation to study, be tested on a wider variety of problems, master the concepts and develop a habit of self-learning. It helps the teacher to continually review a student’s progress as part of grading and evaluating worksheets and fine-tune individual lesson plans, if necessary.
