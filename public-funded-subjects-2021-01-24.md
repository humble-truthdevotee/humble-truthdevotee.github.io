Each module of Social Sciences will have one book. What can be the dept of these topics? Let's do the calculations.

Assuming,

Time required to read 250 words = [1 minute](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettnelson/2012/06/04/do-you-read-fast-enough-to-be-successful/?sh=4c7c42fd462e)

Time required to understand 250 words, say 10 minutes

Number of words in one A4 sized page (with 12-point font) = approx. 250

3 hours of reading per week

3 months = 12 weeks = 36 hours = 2160 minutes of reading, which means *216 pages*. --- (1)

1 hour of practicing questions per week

1 minute per MCQ, Fill in the Black, Truw/False Question

5 minutes for a paragraph type questions

30 MCQs + 6 paragraph type questions = approx. 5 pages (this is per week)

So, *60 pages* for this in total --- (2)

Adding (1) and (2), *Total Length of Book = 276 pages*. So, length of book can be approximately **300 pages** with pictorial illustrations.
