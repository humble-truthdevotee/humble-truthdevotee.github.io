# Math Teaching Techniques

*24 January 2021*

[Here](https://www.rahulmehta.com/edu02.htm#techniques), Rahul Mehta has written that 

>In the Saatya Procedures, the student or his parents pick the teacher they like and the reward system ensures full motivation of teacher and student. So that a student can learn at his own pace, the reward system allows student (and his teachers) of any age to get rewards.

>Now it is completely left with teacher to pick the teaching technique and if the parents are unhappy, they can switch the teacher. The teaching techniques are NOT part of EDU.02 [Aside : the best Maths-teaching system I have come across is Kumon System and I will describe it in some other booklet.]

Now, the last line, i.e. "the best Maths-teaching system I have come across is Kumon System and I will describe it in some other booklet." intrigued me. I went on and studied about the Kumon System of teaching Mathematics. I had previously studied some English at Kumon and my younger brother had studied Mathematics, so I went on to ask him how it worked. He remembered it vaguely, so I went on to read about it on the itnernet. Unfortunately, there is very limited information about Kumon (with practically little to no study material uploaded on the internet). I also contacted Mr. Mehta himself and asked him if he has written that "booklet" he was talking about in that article. He told me to contact a Kumon center and ask them how it works and also told me that I wouldn't be able to find much about it because it is a business. 

I found there [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/kumon), and from there I found [AcademicHub](https://academichub.ru). On AcademicHub, you can find some of their worksheets (especially for higher levels). Unfortunately, AacademicHub is unavalaible, but you can find worksheets by joining their discord server ([invite link](https://discord.gg/jdrT3XTHpr)).

In addition, I also went through [kumon.com](https://kumon.com) and [https://kumon.org) and understood their method of learning.

In this blog post, I'll summarize everything for you so that you can understand their method of learning. 

A brief introduction to the kumon method: 

[from Wikipedia]

Kumon is an enrichment or remedial program,[9] where instructors and assistants tailor instruction for individual students.

Each student is given an initial assessment of his or her abilities, called the Kumon Diagnostic Test. Each test has a range of 20–60 questions. Based on the results and the student's study skills, a Kumon Instructor will create an individualized-study plan.

Students commonly begin Kumon at an 'easy starting point' to build study habits, concentration and a strong understanding of the fundamental topics. As students progress, Kumon Instructors plan for students to study at a difficulty level that aims to challenge students so they remain motivated but not so difficult as to discourage them. The study plan is regularly updated by the Kumon Instructor to match the ability of each student. Students advance to the next level after they complete a mastery test based on speed and accuracy. Students do not pass or fail the mastery test, but are given chances to practice and retake the exam until they have demonstrated a sound understanding of the material.

Kumon has two core programs, the Kumon Math and Kumon Native Language Program. There are also Kumon Japanese and Kumon Kokugo courses for Japanese language speakers and a Pencil Skills Program for younger students.

All Kumon programs are pencil and worksheet based. The worksheets increase in difficulty in small increments. It is recommended that students study for 15–30 minutes for five days of the week with the other two study days being completed when students visit their local Kumon Center.

**How is Kumon Different from School Math?**

From [kumon.com](https://kumon.com)
 
Dribble, pass, shoot! Young soccer players complete endless drills learning these core skills before ever using them in a game. When it comes time to apply them in an actual competition, the moves come automatically. Similarly, many violinists learn proper hand positioning before they ever pick up a bow. When they begin to play, they’re simply stringing together the basic skills they’ve already mastered.
 
What do soccer and the violin have to do with Kumon? Just as athletes and musicians learn skills before applying them in games or performances, students in Kumon learn math skills before applying them in real-life situations. This is a key difference between Kumon Math and the math that is taught in most school systems in North America. It’s also what makes Kumon the perfect supplement to school math.
 
Mathematics vs. the Application of Mathematics
 
While school curriculums can vary significantly, most school math programs teach the application of math. That means that students learn math as it is used in the real world. For example, students might learn addition through scenarios like, “Emma has one apple in her basket. She adds one more apple to the basket. Emma now has two apples.” This may seem like an intuitive way to learn math—after all, that’s how most of us were introduced to adding. And what’s the point of learning math if you can’t use it in the real world?
 
As the math concepts get more difficult, the real-life application gets more complex, compounding the problem. A naturally talented soccer player may be able to excel on a recreational team without having honed her skills, but as the level of competition gets more difficult, her skill gaps will become more apparent. Similarly, a math student may be able to grasp basic concepts with little practice, but as the math gets more challenging, the gaps will begin to show.
 
Unlike school, Kumon teaches strictly mathematics. In Kumon, it is not technically necessary to understand how to apply 1+1=2 in the real world. Students simply must learn that 1+1=2 is a true statement. Students then learn that 2+1=3, 3+1=4, and so on. Math is taught incrementally, with students progressing step-by-step from counting all the way through calculus. As students do not need to have real world experience to learn what is strictly mathematics, even elementary school students can progress to algebra and beyond. Eventually, as students’ number sense and real world experience come together, they are able to apply what they’ve learned in different contexts.
 
Some might find it counterintuitive to learn mathematics without its applications. After all, why learn what one plus one equals if you can’t make the connection that adding one penny to another equals two cents? However, once a student has learned a math concept, they then have an easier time learning how to apply it. Some math applications are included in the Kumon Program, but it is only introduced once a student has mastered the mathematical concepts. Without a strong base in the necessary math skills, students will reach a point where applying math is too difficult.  Just as a soccer player learns how to dribble the ball before applying that skill in a game, students should learn math skills before applying the concepts in real life situations.
