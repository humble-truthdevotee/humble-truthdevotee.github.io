# Exemptions related to Empty Land Tax

*27 January 2020*

**Note: In this article, Wealth Tax = Empty Land Tax = [Land Value Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax) = ELT = LVT**

In [this](https://youtu.be/FuC3_PakcnA) video, Mr. Mehta has explained how 1% ELT can raise a revenue of Rs. 11 lakh crore, which is enough to end GST (and thus make India's taxation more progressive). However, he argues that due to high prevelance of land hoarding (to create artificial scarcity), a lot of land owners will either rent or sell their land once ELT is implemented. Subsequently, more land will become availaible for use and so land prices will drop significantly. As land prices drop, a significant chunk of capital will become abundant enough to drive business and increase incomes. He believes only Rs. 2 lakh crore will come. But, the subsequent rise in incomes will raise some Rs. 8-9 lakh crore as income tax. 

If Rs. 2 lakh crore are raised from a 1% ELT, other components of the ELT will be as follows:

**ELT for Law Enforcement = 0.25% (as per [301.pdf](https://rahulmehta.com/301.pdf))

ELT for Social Upliftment (see chapter on reservation in [301.pdf](https://rahulmehta.com/301.pdf)) = 0.5%

ELT for Math & Science Education (see [Saatya System](https://www.rahulmehta.com/edu02.htm)) = 0.25%** (to understand how I came up with this number, read [this](https://humble-truthdevotee.github.io/cost-of-implementing-saatya-system) article)

Therefore, the total ELT will be **2%**.
