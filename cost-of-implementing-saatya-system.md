# Cost of Implementing Saatya System

Saatya System: https://www.rahulmehta.com/edu02.htm

[Status: This page will be re-written for clarity, I'll update it in a few days]

Now, IMO this is how the system should work (this is somewhat different and somewhat similar to Rahul ji's plan):

- The syllabus of the twelve years of Math (and other subjects) will be divided into 48 quaters (I'll call them "terms" from now) of three months each. 
- There will be 4 tests for Math and Science subjects: 3 mid-terms every 3 weeks + 1 full term test at the end of the three months.
- The points distribution will be ask follows: 25% for three mid-terms (with the lowest score being dropped) + 50% for the full term test.
- Mid-terms will be of 1 hour each and will contain 20 objective questions. The full term test will be of 2 hours and will contain 40 objective questions.

The salary of the teacher will be decided as follows: 

Let's take, the current salary of Math teacher for a class as X, number of students he can teach as N and number of students per section as S. So,

**Base Salary per student = (20% of X)/N**

If S = 30-40 students, say 33, N = 33 students * (6 hours/day * 5 days)/(5 hours) = 200 students

If X = Rs. 50,000, then Base Salary = (20% of 50000)/200 = Rs. 50 per student 

*Condition for receiving base salary: if his student receives more than 0 marks in the term tests*

**Bonus**

Considering that 90% of his students should pass, 33% should get (Average + 10%) marks and 33# should get between (Average - 10%) and (Average + 10%) marks, the bonus component should be:

(90% of P) + (33% of A) + (33% of A*2) = Rs. 40,000

(90% of P) + (33% of 3A) = Rs. 40,000

Say money given for A should be double than that of P.

180*P + 66*3*2*P = 40000, i.e. P = Rs. 105 (approx.)

So, if a student passes, his teacher will get Rs. 100/month,
if a student gets between (Average - 10%) and (Average + 10%) marks, his teacher will get Rs. 200/month
if a student gets more than (Average + 10%) marks, his teacher will get Rs. 400/month. 

**Student Rewards**

Rs. 90 for passing

Rs. 60 more for marks between (Average - 10%) and (Average + 10%)

Rs. 120 more for more than (Average + 10%) marks

This will settle the total cost of student rewards at about Rs. 45000 crore.
