# Thomas Jefferson on Democracy

*18 November 2020*

When I was having doubts about actually believing in majority rule (not only representative democracy), I came across some quotes of Thomas Jefferson in Rahul Mehta's [Bootstrapping (US Edition)](https://www.rahulmehta.com/usa.bootstrapping.pdf). They answered a lot of my doubts. This is an excerpt from his book:

>The first principle of republicanism is that the lex majoris partis is the fundamental law of every society of individuals of equal rights; to consider the will of the society enounced by the majority of   a single vote as sacred as if unanimous is the first of all lessons in importance, yet the last which is thoroughly learnt. This law once disregarded, no other remains but that of force, which ends necessarily in military despotism. 

-- Thomas Jefferson to Alexander von  Humboldt, 1817. (1)

>The voice of  the majority decides. For the lex majoris partis is the law of all councils, elections,  etc., where not otherwise expressly provided.

-- Thomas Jefferson: Parliamentary Manual, 1800.(2)

>The will of the people... is the only legitimate foundation of any government, and to protect its free expression should be our first object. 

-- Thomas Jefferson to Benjamin Waring, 1801. (3)

>The measures of the fair majority... ought always to be respected.

-- Thomas Jefferson to George Washington, 1792	(4)

>All	being equally free, no one has a right to say what shall be law for the others. Our way is to put these questions to the vote, and to consider that as law for which the majority votes.

-- Thomas Jefferson: Address to the Cherokee Nation, 1809. (6)

This is how he described US

>This... [is] a country where the will of the majority is the law, and ought to be the law. 

-- Thomas Jefferson: Answers to de Meusnier Questions, 1786. ME 17:85 (8)

When I asked “can the majority be wrong”? he told me 

>[With a majority] having declared against [our proposal], we must suppose we  are  wrong,  according to the fundamental law of every society, the lex majoris partis, to which we are bound to submit.

-- Thomas Jefferson to David Humphreys, 1789. The Only Source of Just Power (10)

>It is my principle that the will of the majority should prevail. If they approve the proposed constitution in all its parts, I shall concur in it cheerfully, in hopes that they will amend it whenever they shall find it works wrong. This reliance cannot deceive us, as long as we remain virtuous. 

-- Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, 1787. (Forrest version) ME 6:392

>It is an encouraging observation that no good measure was ever proposed which, if duly pursued, failed to prevail in the end.

-- Thomas Jefferson to Edward Coles, 1814.	(11)

I asked him why he is so much fond of majority. He replied:

>I know no safe depositary of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome  discretion,  the  remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power.

-- Thomas Jefferson to William C. Jarvis, 1820. ME 15:278	(12)
