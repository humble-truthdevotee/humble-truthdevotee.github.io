# betaBootstrapping

## About the movement

Sometime ago, I came across this political movement which aims to improve India's laws, administration and courts, called "[Bootstrapping](https://www.rahulmehta.com/what_is_boot.htm)". It was started by [Rahul C Mehta](https://www.rahulmehta.com/). In the past 4 years, I have read a lot of his material, which includes his analysis and legal proposals. I often had to study a lot of things to understand it better. I also developed my own political beliefs while reading his material. In this website, I'll post my thoughts on Rahul Mehta's analysis & proposals and about India's laws, administration and courts in general. Hence, the name "betaBootstrapping", as in this is my beta test of his works before I join the movement. 

Before you go ahead and read either his work or my analysis, I must let you know that from what I understand, his works are loosely related to (or based on) Economic Nationalism and Hindu (or Indic) Civilizational Nationalism.

## About the author

I'm Humble Truth-devotee. Technically, I should be called "Polite Truth-deity"; however, I changed my name, because of the following two reasons: 

<ol>
  <li>I call myself "Humble" instead of "Polite" because in my opinion politeness without humbleness is fiction.</li>
  <li>I'm far from being a deity, hence I call myself a devotee of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya">Satya</a>.</li>
</ol>
